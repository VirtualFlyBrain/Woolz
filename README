1) What is Woolz?
-----------------


Woolz is a set of software libraries and executables for image processing
and pattern recognition. It has been written in ANSI standard C so that
it will build and run on all computing platforms that support some basic
requirements, such as supporting at least 32 bit integers. The software
is know to build on GNU/Linux, MacOSX and Solaris systems. It will also
build using MingW on Windows systems.

The code is partitioned into the following modules:

libAlc:		Library providing generic data structures and memory allocation functions.
libAlg:		Library providing basic numerical algorithms.
libbibfile:     Library with bibfile style input/output functions.
libhguDlpList:  Library with a generic doubly linked pointer list.
libReconstruct: Library with code for 3D alignment of 2D section images to form a 3D image.
libWlz:         The Woolz image processing library.
libWlzBnd:      Library with small functions that bind Woolz to other languages.
libWlzExtFF:    Library for external data format input/output.
java:           Directory structure in which the Woolz java binding can be built.
binWlz:         Small command line based Woolz programs.
binWlzApp:      More small command line based Woolz programs.
binWlzExtFF:    Small command line based Woolz programs which use external file formats.
binWlzTst:      Small command line based test programs for Woolz.

1c) Other Acknowledgements
--------------------------

The skeleton for the autoconf system was shamelessly copied from Tina
(http://www.tina-vision.net).

2) Where can I get the Woolz software?
--------------------------------------

While we plan to release Woolz to some public code repository, currently it can
only be obtained (both as source code and compilled code) from the MRC Human Genetics Unit,
Edinburgh, UK.

3. How can I build Woolz?
-------------------------

3a) Install instructions
------------------------

Woolz should build easily on most modern systems that have the GNU Autoconf and Automake
tools.

In most cases the following should be sufficient to build Woolz:

tar -zxf Woolz.tgz
cd Woolz/src/Core

aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
./configure --enable-extff --enable-optimise
make 

A prefix can be given in the configure stage to define where the programs, libraries
etc will be installed. Use

./configure --help

to see this and more options.

3b) Compatibility issues
