1) What is Woolz?
----------------


Woolz is a set of software libraries and executables for image processing
and pattern recognition. It has been written in ANSI standard C so that
it will build and run on all computing platforms that support some basic
requirements, such as supporting at least 32 bit integers. The software
is know to build on GNU/Linux, MacOSX and Solaris systems. It will also
build using MingW on Windows systems.

The code is partitioned into the following modules:

libAlc:		A basic library providing generic data structures and
		memory allocation functions.
