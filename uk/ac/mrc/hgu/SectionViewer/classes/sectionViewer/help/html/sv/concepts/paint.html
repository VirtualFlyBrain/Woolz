   <p>
   The underlying 3D image and the 2D sections that are displayed in the section viewer are grey-level images. In other words they are made up of areas which vary between black (grey level = 0) and white (grey level = 255).
   </p>

   <p>
   The 3D image can be thought of as comprising a stack of 2D sections, (like a pack of playing cards). In order to define a particular anatomy component each 2D section that cuts through the component must have the relevant area highlighted. The collection of highlighted areas is stacked together to form a new 3D image which is the anatomy component.
   </p>

   <p>
   The process of defining anatomy components in this way is referred to as painting.
