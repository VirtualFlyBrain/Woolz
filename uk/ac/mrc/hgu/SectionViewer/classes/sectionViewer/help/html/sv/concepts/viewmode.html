   <p>
   The <b>view mode</b> describes how a 2D section through the 3D image is projected onto a viewing surface (such as the computer screen).
   <br>In practice, the two view modes available in this programme may be differentiated by their effect on the <b>roll</b> angle ...
   <ul>
   <li><b>up is up</b> mode calculates the <b>roll</b> angle automatically. When this mode is selected it is not possible to manually change <b>roll</b> angle.</li>
   <li><b>absolute</b> mode allows the user to manually change <b>roll</b> angle.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
