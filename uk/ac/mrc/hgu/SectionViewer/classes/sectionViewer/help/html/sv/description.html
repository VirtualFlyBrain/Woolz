   <h2>Section Viewer</h2>
   </center>

   <p>
   This is a java class which can be used in conjunction with a 3D viewer programme to display 2D grey-level images derived from the (MRC proprietory) <b>Woolz</b> format.
   <br>
   The 3D viewer programme spawns (2D) section views in one of three initial orientations (XY, YZ or ZX).
   </p>

   <p>
   Controls are available to manipulate the position of the section in relation to the 3D image. Any arbitrary section is obtainable. The section viewer uses native <b>Woolz</b> libraries (written in C) to calculate each new section.
   </p>

   <p>
   Feedback is available (based on the cursor position in the grey-level image). The feedback relates to the x,y,z coordinates in the original 3D image. It also gives the grey level at the cursor position.
   </p>

   <p>
   If the image has anatomy associated with it, it may be possible to highlight this in the grey-level image by selecting anatomy components from a menu in the 3D viewer programme.
   </p>

   <p>
   The section viewer can identify the anatomy component at the cursor position if required.
