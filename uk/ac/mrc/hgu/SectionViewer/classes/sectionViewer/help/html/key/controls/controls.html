      <h2>&LT anatomy key &GT controls</h2>
   </center>

   <p>
   Each row in the anatomy key has its own set of controls.
   <br>
   From left to right, starting next to the coloured patch the controls are ...
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>left/right arrow buttons</li>
      Clicking on one of these arrow buttons scrolls the text field fully to the left or right respectively.

      <li>scrollable text field</li>
      This displays the (fully qualified) name of the anatomy component.
      <br>To scroll left or right, press the left mouse button in the text field and drag the mouse left or right respectively.
      <li>visibility checkbox</li>
      This checkbox toggles the visibility (highlighting) of an anatomy component (in section views).
      <li>zap/replace button</li>
      Clicking on this button when the <b>zap</b> (lightning) symbol is displayed will remove the anatomy component from the key. (The <b>replace</b> (arrow) symbol will then appear.) The component will no longer be highlighted in section views.
      <p>Clicking on this button when the <b>replace</b> symbol is displayed will replace the anatomy component in the key. (The <b>zap</b> symbol will re-appear.) The component will be highlighted again.
      </p>
      <p>When a <b>replace</b> symbol is displayed, that slot in the key will be used if a further anatomy selection is made from the menu. The original anatomy component will no longer be available (unless it is re-selected from the menu).
      </p>
   </ul>
