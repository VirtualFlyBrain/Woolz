   <ul>
      <li>A coloured border defining the section and identifying its section viewer.</li>
      <li>A coloured rectangle defining the section and identifying its section viewer.</li>
      <li>A rectangle showing the 2D image of the section and having a coloured border to identify its section viewer.</li>
      <li>An arrow showing the viewing direction for a particular section .</li>
   </ul>
