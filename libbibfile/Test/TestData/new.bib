 Water = {We *all* know that boiling water = bad coffee!
The simplest way to get \
water at the right temperature
(you don't want it too far below boiling either...)
is to first get a full rolling boil going. Then, take the
water off the fire and add a healthy splash of cold (room-temp) water.
About 1/4 cup in a kettle (roughly one part in 20) of cold water added
will bring the temperature down a few degrees.

Boiling the water and then cooling it gives the same result as bringing
it up to just below a boil. Also, when the vapor bubbles start to form
(I use a glass kettle), the water is still well below boiling temp.
(check it with a decent thermometer!) So, getting a full boil and then
cooling it a bit is pretty reliable and simple...   $^)
