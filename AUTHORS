The Woolz software has been developed over many years by many people with its
roots in chromosome spread image analysis and microscopy imaging.  The primary
code design and develoment is due to Denis Rutovitz with the initial C
implementation was due to Jim Piper.  Since 1994 the code has been maintained
and extended by Richard Baldock, Bill Hill and Jianguo Rao at the MRC Human
Genetics, Edinburgh, UK.
