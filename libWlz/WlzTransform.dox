* Woolz transforms are Woolz domains 
* that define either 2D or 3D spatial transformation.
*
* An affine transform is a transformation
* which preserves lines and the parralelism of lines,
* but not the lengths or the angles between (non parrallel) lines.
* The affine transform can be defined by a homogeneous matrix, which for
* 2D transforms is a 3x3 matrix and for 3D transforms is a 4x4 matrix.
* However in a Woolz affine transform the homogeneous matrix is
* always a allocated as a 4x4 matrix, with only the first 3 rows and
* columns used for a 2D transform.
*
* A mesh transform defines an approximate topology preseving transformation
* within the region covered by the mesh. The mesh itself consists of
* a number of nodes which are connected by simplical elements.
* The transform displaces each node of the mesh according to the node
* displacement and interpolates displacements within the mesh elements.
* It is particularly useful for implementing other transforms such as
* the basis function transforms. In 2D a mesh transform is defined by
* a triangular mesh, in 3D it is defined by a tetrahedral mesh.
*
* A basis function transform is the sum of a set of radialy symetric
* component transforms. With each component transform defined by node
* and some set of parameters which specify the displacement of points
* distant from the node, the displacements having radial symmetry.
