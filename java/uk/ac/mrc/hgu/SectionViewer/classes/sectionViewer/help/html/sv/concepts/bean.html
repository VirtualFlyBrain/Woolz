   <br>Java Bean</h2>
   </center>

   <p>
   A <b>Java Bean</b> is a component, usually with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), that can be dropped into other applications. Java Development Environments can detect the public 'get and set' methods of the component and thus allow it to be customised.

   <p>
   This particular component may be displayed in a JFrame (external to the main application window) or in a JInternalFrame. The component has a parent class which manages the creation of multiple SectionViewers. Different methods in this parent class determine wether the component is displayed in an internal or external frame.
