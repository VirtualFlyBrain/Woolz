* \mainpage Woolz Command Line Binaries
* \section intro Introduction
The Woolz library functions are complemented by a set of binaries for 
command line processing of Woolz formatted data. Most binaries can read data
from standard input and will write to standard output and can therefore 
be used in unix "pipeline" mode. This allows efficient concatenation of
multiple imaging operations for rapid prototyping and script development.

The binary codes are all installed in the Mouse Atlas home bin directory
(usually /opt/MouseAtlas/bin) and provide a significant proportion of the
libWlz plus supplementary library functionality. Simple binaries for
 the basic Woolz functions are under \ref BinWlz "binWlz", other binaries
relating to format conversion are under \ref BinWlzExtFF "binWlzExtFF" and
more complex applications can be found under \ref BinWlzApp "binWlzApp".
